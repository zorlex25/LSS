This script works for Leitstellenspiel.de.
The script automatically sends a vehicle to each unit mission so you can earn credits there. Of course, the vehicles that should/may be sent are configurable.
The script offers various settings, including the ability to prioritize certain vehicle types that should/may be sent. An auto-run function that can be set to run every X minutes and start new shared missions. Some other customizations are also possible!
It's not worth downloading the script without a license, etc. The script automatically blocks unlicensed users if they attempt to use it!
Use at your own risk; no liability is assumed!
The script can be purchased for a monthly fee of â‚¬4!
